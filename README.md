# Communere Test Project

This project was created as a test project for the Communere company. It aims to demonstrate my coding skills and problem-solving abilities within a given timeframe. Please note that due to the time constraints, not all the code follows best practices or optimizations. Some elements, such as unnecessary try-catch blocks, may be present.
